<h2> Objective </h2>
<p> I started with a Bachelor's degree in Media Arts and Animation until I realized my real passion existed elsewhere.. I did some research and found that if I were to deliver for Uber Eats and work hard enough to hit the 1000 delivery mark I could earn myself a full scholarship to Arizona State University. My hard work paid off and it was there that I began studying web development and completed the ASU Global Tech program! The best is yet to come. </p>
